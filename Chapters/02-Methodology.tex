\section{Apparatus}\label{sec:apparatus}
\subsection{Airfoil Wake Measurements}
An airfoil is positioned in the wind tunnel test chamber as seen in \autoref{fig: AirFoilAndPressureRake}. Downstream of the airfoil is a pressure rake consisting of \num{46} pressure taps, each spaced \qty{2}{\milli\meter} apart. The pressure taps are connected to Scanivalve pressure transducers. A computer with data acquisition software collects measurements from the pressure transducers and stores the data in \verb|.csv| files.

\subsection{Hot Wire Anemometer Calibration}
A hot wire anemometer and pitot tube are positioned in the test chamber of a small wind tunnel as seen in \autoref{fig: OpenCircutWindTunnel} and \autoref{fig: HotWireAndPitot}. The pitot tube is connected to a Mensor manometer. Both the anemometer and Mensor manometer are connected to a computer with data acquisition software to collect measurements and store the data in \verb|.txt| files.

\section{Procedure}\label{sec:procedures}
\subsection{Airfoil Wake Measurements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calibrate the instruments with the wind tunnel set to \qty{0}{\hertz}.
\item Set the wind tunnel velocity at \qty{15}{\hertz}. Wait for velocity to become relatively uniform. 
\item Set the \acrshort{aoa} to \qty{0}{\degree}.
\item Move the rake to cover the entire wake of the airfoil as necessary.
\item Acquire and save the data to a data file.
\item Repeat steps 3-4 using the following \acrshort{aoa}s: \numlist{4;6;8;10;12;14;16}.
\item Save the data to a flash drive for past-lab analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hot Wire Anemometer Calibration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set the hot wire calibration tunnel to \qty{20}{\percent} power.
    \item Record the voltage data acquired by the data acquisition software and the pressure data from the Mensor digital pressure gauge.
    \item Repeat steps 1-2 for \qtyrange{20}{60}{\percent} power in increments of \qty{4}{\percent}.
    \item Save the data to a flash drive for post-lab analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Derivations} \label{sec:derivations}
The coefficient of pressure is found by normalizing the dynamic pressure measured by the pressure taps with the free-stream dynamic pressure. The difference between the inlet and outlet pressure of the contraction section, \gls{P_A} and \gls{P_E}, respectively, along with the wind tunnel calibration constant, \gls{K}, determines the free-stream dynamic pressure denoted by \gls{q_inf}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:q_inf}
    q_\infty = K (P_A - P_E)
\end{equation}
The dynamic pressure at a singular tap from the pressure rake, generically described as the $i$th tap, is found by subtracting the total pressure measured by the tap with the free-stream static pressure.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:q_i}
    q_i = P_i - P_E 
\end{equation}
Therefore, the coefficient of pressure can be found by dividing \autoref{eq:q_i} by \autoref{eq:q_inf}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C_P}
    C_P = \frac{q_i}{q_\infty} = \frac{P_i - P_E }{K (P_A - P_E)}
\end{equation}
To begin calculations on the coefficient of drag, the flow velocity at each pressure tap is found by rearranging the generic dynamic pressure equation, $q = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:U_i}
    U_i = \sqrt{\frac{2 q_i}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 (P_i - P_E)}{\rho}}
\end{equation}
The free-stream flow velocity is found similarly: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:U_inf}
    U_\infty = \sqrt{\frac{2 q_\infty}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 K (P_A - P_E)}{\rho}}
\end{equation}
The coefficient of drag is found by using the fluid momentum change as drag resulting in \autoref{eq:C_D}, where \gls{C} is the chord of the airfoil and \gls{y} is the area downstream of the airfoil \citep{lab6-manual}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C_D}
    C_D = \frac{2}{C} \int \left[\frac{U_y}{U_\infty}\left(1-\frac{U_y}{U_\infty}\right)\right]dy
\end{equation}
The coefficient of drag can be approximated with the data collected from the pressure rake using a Midpoint Riemann Sum of the pressure taps, where \gls{C} is the chord and \gls{d} is the distance between each pressure tap.
\begin{equation}
    C_D = \frac{2}{C} \sum_{i=1}^{45} d\frac{\left[\frac{U_i}{U_\infty}\left(1-\frac{U_i}{U_\infty}\right)\right] + \left[\frac{U_{i+1}}{U_\infty}\left(1-\frac{U_{i+1}}{U_\infty}\right)\right]}{2}
\end{equation}
