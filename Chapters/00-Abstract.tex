Using the low-speed wind tunnel at Iowa State University, we analyzed the wake distribution of an airfoil using a pressure rake connected to pressure transducers. We collected pressure data from the pressure rake for different angles of attack to create a profile of the airfoil wake region and estimate the coefficient of drag. Our data showed the presence of significant turbulence and vortices at angles of attack greater than \qty{12}{\degree}. Additionally, to facilitate more precise velocity measurements in future labs, we calculated the fourth order calibration curve of a hot wire anemometer to relate the measured voltage to airspeed.
