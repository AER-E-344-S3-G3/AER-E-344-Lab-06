We first took wake pressure measurements for the GA(W)1 airfoil at different AOAs using the Scanivalve DSA 3217. Next, for the second part of the lab, we used a pitot tube to calibrate the Hot Wire Anemometer. Then, we took the data we collected and calculated the pressure distribution of the wake for each angle of attack and we also calculated the calibration constant for the Hot Wire Anemometer which is important for converting voltage data measurements into meaningful data.
